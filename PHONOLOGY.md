# Phonology

The language's phonology is very simple, consisting of only **5** vowels and **7** consonants.

| *Vowels* | Front Unrounded | Back Unrounded | Back Rounded |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **High** | i |&nbsp;| u |
| **Mid** | e |&nbsp;| o |
| **Low** |&nbsp;| a |&nbsp;|

| *Consonants* | Labial | Alveolar Central | Alveolar Lateral | Velar | Glottal |
|------|--------|------------------|------------------|-------|---------|
| **Stop** | p, b | t, d |&nbsp;| k, g |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
| **Nasal** | m | n |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
| **Liquid** |&nbsp;|&nbsp;| l |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|
| **Non-sibilant Affricate** |&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;| h |

**NOTE:** The consonant pairs **(p, b)**, **(t, d)**, and **(k, g)** are treated as one distinct consonant,
meaning that their voiced and unvoiced sounds can be used interchangibly to represent the same consonant.
This means that you can, for example, use the **b** sound anywhere over the **p** sound, or vise versa. There
are no rules for this, just use the sound that feels more natural in certain words.

# Syllable Rules

- Consonant must **always** come before a vowel, and as a result, no consonant clusters can exist
- Vowels can be used freely and can be combined to create dipthongs, with some exceptions:
  - Adjacent dipthongs can be merged when pronouncing if it sounds more natural, for example, `uai` pronounce like the english word `why`
  - Double-vowels, for example `aa`, are uncommon, but if encountered, should be pronounced in a *rising*, question-like tone
  - `i-` creates a `y-` sound, for example, `ia` is pronounced as `ya`
  - `e-` only exists for `ei`, which is pronounced like the name of the English letter `A`
  - `a-` only exists for `ai`, which is pronounced like the name of the English letter `I`
  - `o-` is unused, as the sounds it produces are unnatural
  - `u-` creates a `w-` sound, for example, `ua` is pronounced as `wa`
