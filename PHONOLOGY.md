# Phonology

The language's phonology is very simple, consisting of only **5** vowels and **7** consonants.

| *Vowels* | Front Unrounded | Back Unrounded | Back Rounded |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **High** | i |&nbsp;| u |
| **Mid** | e |&nbsp;| o |
| **Low** |&nbsp;| a |&nbsp;|

| *Consonants* | Labial | Alveolar Central | Velar |
|--------------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Stop** | p, b | t, d | k, g |
| **Nasal** | m | n |&nbsp;|
| **Liquid** |&nbsp;| l |&nbsp;|
| **Sibilant Fricative** |&nbsp;| s, z |&nbsp;|

**NOTE:** The consonant pairs **(p, b)**, **(t, d)**, **(k, g)**, and **(s, z)** are treated as one distinct consonant,
meaning that their voiced and unvoiced sounds can be used interchangibly to represent the same consonant.
This means that you can, for example, use the **b** sound anywhere over the **p** sound, or vise versa. There
are no rules for this, just use the sound that feels more natural in certain words.
