# Sentence Structure

The language *strictly* follows a **SVO** structure. No sentence will ever deviate from this structure,
otherwise it is grammatically incorrect.

Possible sentence patterns:

- (Subject)
- (Subject) [Verb]
- (Subject) [Verb] \<Object\>
- [Verb]
- [Verb] \<Object\>

If a sentence does not follow one of these patterns, it is grammatically incorrect.

**Subject:** The *thing* doing the *action*.

**Verb:** The *action*.

**Object:** The *thing* being affected by the *action*.

# Grammar Rules

**NOTE:** This document is a WIP (work in progress).

- There is no *tense*, *gender*, or *verb conjugation*
- *Tenses* are implied by using *time words*, or simply, words that describe something about *time*
- *Time words* (almost) always come first as a part of the **subject**
- **Verbs** are always in plain form, meaning you do not ever need to conjugate them
