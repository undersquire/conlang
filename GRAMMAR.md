# Sentence Structure

The language *strictly* follows a **SVO** structure. No sentence will ever deviate from this structure,
otherwise it is grammatically incorrect.

Possible sentence patterns:

- (Subject)
- (Subject) [Verb]
- (Subject) [Verb] \<Object\>
- [Verb]
- [Verb] \<Object\>

If a sentence does not follow one of these patterns, it is grammatically incorrect.

**Subject:** The *thing* doing the *action*.

**Verb:** The *action*.

**Object:** The *thing* being affected by the *action*.

# Grammar Rules

**NOTE:** This document is a WIP (work in progress).

**NOTE 2:** This language has no concept of *tense*, *gender*, or *verb conjugation*.

- **Verbs** are always in plain form, meaning you do not ever need to conjugate them
- *Adverbs* and *adjectives* always come before the **noun**/**verb** they apply to
- *Time words* are (almost) always used as adverbs
- *Tenses* are implied by using *time words*, or simply, words that describe something about *time*,
such as using the adverb for "tomorrow" to imply the future tense to a verb
